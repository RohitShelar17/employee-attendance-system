 * that deletes only the tables it knows about trips over rows another class
 * left behind — an employee cannot be removed while a shift assignment, a user
 * or a leave request still points at it.
 *
 * <p>Each class was previously listing its own deletes, which meant every new
 * table broke an unrelated test the first time the suite ran in a different
 * order. One ordered list, in one place, removes that whole class of failure.
